# Ground-Target-Dataset
The introduced dataset has been used in deep detection networks training to accomplish tracking and following a ground target from a flying UAV.

<p>Three ground target prototypes (Aircraft, Tank, and Jeep) have been utilized to build this dataset which contains 8165 frames have been taken with different backgrounds, illuminations, resolutions, and perspective angles.

<p>Thus, the dataset reflects the requirement of detecting the target from any approaching point. i.e., considering the target is placed at a circle center with any heading angle and the UAV at any point on that circle circumference has the ability to detect it.

<p>The dataset comprises 8165 images. Each image has its corresponding annotation file with the same name. The annotation files are given in XML format which contains the targets names alongside their bounding boxes to facilitate the training of the deep detection networks.
