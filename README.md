# Ground-Target-Dataset
The introduced dataset has been used in deep detection networks training to accomplish tracking and following a ground target from a flying UAV.

<p>Three ground target prototypes (Aircraft, Tank, and Jeep) have been utilized to build this dataset which contains 8165 frames have been taken with different backgrounds, illuminations, resolutions, and perspective angles.

<p>Thus, the dataset reflects the requirement of detecting the target from any approaching point. i.e., considering the target is placed at a circle center with any heading angle and the UAV at any point on that circle circumference has the ability to detect it.
